/**
 * MCP shim for master_architect.
 *
 * Project-aware code skeleton + navigation engine. Hierarchical addressing
 * for the eye-model: numeric for parseable code, letters for opaque/coming-soon
 * files, all addressable as link targets.
 *
 * Implementation lives in /tank/projects/mcp-servers/tools/master-architect/
 * — this file just re-exports the tool definition so server-modular.js's
 * mcp_tools/ loader picks it up.
 *
 * DB lives at /tank/projects/mcp-servers/tools/master-architect/master-architect.db
 * (overridable via MASTER_ARCHITECT_DB env var for multi-tenant deployments).
